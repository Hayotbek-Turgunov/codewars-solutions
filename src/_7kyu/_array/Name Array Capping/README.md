# From Ruby 3.0, RSpec is used under the hood.
# See https://rspec.info/
# Defaults to the global `describe` for backwards compatibility, but `RSpec.desribe` works as well.
describe "Example" do
  it "should return the sum" do
    expect(add(1, 1)).to eq(2)
    # The following is still supported, but new tests should now use them.
    # Test.assert_equals(add(1, 1), 2)
  end
end
