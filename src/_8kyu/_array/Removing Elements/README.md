# Solution for problem:

[Find the first non-consecutive number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f8a3a27a5c28d92e000144)

**Description:**
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

### Examples

```plaintext
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
