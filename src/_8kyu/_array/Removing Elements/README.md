# Solution for problem:

[Removing Elements](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5769b3802ae6f8e4890009d2)

**Description:**
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

### Examples

```plaintext
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
