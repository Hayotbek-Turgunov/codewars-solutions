# Codewars 4 kyu Challenges Solved

This repository contains solutions to several 4 kyu level problems on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com). Each problem tackles different algorithmic challenges and programming techniques.

## 4 kyu Problems Solved

### 1. [Adding Big Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/525f4206b73515bffb000b21/)

This challenge involves adding two extremely large numbers together, which surpass the usual integer limit in many programming languages. This requires a custom algorithm to handle the overflow.

### 2. [Human Readable Duration Format](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52742f58faf5485cae000b9a/)

In this problem, the goal is to convert a given number of seconds into a human-readable format, such as "1 year, 2 days, 3 hours, 4 minutes, and 5 seconds".

### 3. [Longest Slide Down](https://www.codewars.com/kata/551f23362ff852e2ab000037/)

This problem asks to find the maximum sum possible when moving down a triangular structure of numbers, choosing only adjacent numbers on each row.

### 4. [Range Extraction](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51ba717bb08c1cd60f00002f/)

Here, the task is to condense a list of integers into a range format, combining consecutive numbers into a compact string like "1-5, 7-10".

### 5. [Strip Comments](https://www.codewars.com/kata/strip-comments/)

In this challenge, you are asked to remove comments from a string, given specific comment markers, ensuring only the correct portion of the string remains.

### 6. [Sum Strings As Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5324945e2ece5e1f32000370/)

This task is about adding two non-negative numbers presented as strings, taking into account the limitations of number size in standard data types.
